<h3 class="font-weight-light">Hello, Iâ€™m <span class="font-weight-bold">{{site.author.name}}</span></h3>

Welcome to my digital space! I'm a seasoned Data Scientist with a passion for crafting innovative, data-driven solutions to tackle complex business challenges. Currently serving as a Senior Data Scientist at Loylty Rewardz, I orchestrate the fulfillment of data science and engineering requirements crucial to the business.

My journey in Data Science kicked off during an enriching internship at Leadzpipe, a Digital Marketing Start-up. There, I honed my skills in extracting campaign data from Google AdWords, modeling it for NoSQL databases, and deriving actionable insights for clients. This effort earned me recognition at the Aegis Graham Awards in 2020.

Following the internship, I ventured into the dynamic realm of Healthcare at Medly, a US-based startup. As a Data Analyst, I empowered stakeholders with data-driven decision-making by leveraging analytics and machine learning techniques.

Exploring diverse facets of the industry, I delved into consulting at Predoole Analytics, assuming the role of a Data Scientist. Here, I revamped and optimized data pipelines in the insurance sector and spearheaded the development of a Geospatial Product. This innovative tool conducted proximity analyses for retail stores in the US, utilizing Decennial US Census Data.

My academic foundation in Computer Science, complemented by a deep-seated curiosity for the practical applications of mathematics, shaped my journey. A culmination of these experiences and my fascination with the evolving landscape of Machine Learning and Deep Learning led me to embark on a career in Data Science.

Join me on this exploration of turning data into insights and navigating the ever-evolving landscape of technology and analytics.
