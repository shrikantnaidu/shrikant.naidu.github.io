<h3 class="font-weight-light">Hello, Iâ€™m <span class="font-weight-bold">{{site.author.name}}</span></h3>

I'm a Data Scientist with a keen interest in building data-driven solutions for complex business problems. Currently, I'm working as a Senior Data Scientist at Loylty Rewardz where I'm responsible for fulfilling the data science and engineering needs of the business.

I started my journey in Data Science as an intern at a Digital Marketing Start-up called Leadzpipe where I was responsible for extracting the campaign data from Google AdWords, modeling the data for a NoSQL database, and then creating insights with the data for the clients. My work here helped me bag an award at the Aegis Graham Awards 2020.

After the completion of my internship, I started working as a Data Analyst at a rapidly growing Healthcare Start-up based in the US known as Medly where I was responsible for helping my stakeholders make data-driven decisions by leveraging data analytics and machine learning.

Post Medly, I tried my hand at consulting and joined Predoole Analytics as a Data Scientist where I was responsible for restructuring and optimizing the data pipelines in the insurance space. Also, led the development of a Geospatial Product that could perform a proximity analysis for retail stores in the US with the help of the Decennial US Census Data.

I've always been passionately curious about the practicality of Math and Computer Science which led me to pursue a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and then my fascination with the recent development in Machine Learning and Deep Learning directed me towards Data Science.
